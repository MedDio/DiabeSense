# DiabeSense
This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes based on various health-related factors such as age, BMI, glucose levels, and blood pressure. The goal is to build a model that can help in early detection and prevention of diabetes, offering insights into risk factors that contribute to the disease. By leveraging supervised learning techniques, this project aims to provide accurate predictions that can be used for better health management.
